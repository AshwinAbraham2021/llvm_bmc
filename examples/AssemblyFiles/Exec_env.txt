1. 2 threads - minor and major
2. Minor has higher priority (20 ms), cannot be interrupted
3. Major has a periodicity of 500 ms, can be interrupted
4. All inputs are passed through a driver file -  time, minor ID and other time-based inputs are passed from a text file - for standalone testing
5. All functional & TM outputs are collected in a driver file and printed - for standalone testing
6. Variables which can be initialised through an init file, but are given default values in the code
7. Hardware related - interrupts, arithmetic error, code and data memory
8. Scheduling
9. A routine which is invoked only once to initialise all essential variables by driver file
